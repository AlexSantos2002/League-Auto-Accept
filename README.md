# League Auto-Accept

Automatically accepts queue matches in **League of Legends** using the LCU API.

## About

This lightweight Python tool checks the current **game phase** using the local client API and instantly accepts matches when they appear (ReadyCheck phase). Ideal for multitasking or being away from the PC while waiting in queue.

## Features

- Automatically accepts match queue pop-ups
- Detects when the League client is running
- Lightweight background process (optionally starts with Windows)
- No cheats or injection â€“ strictly reads Riot's official client API

## How It Works

It connects to the League of Legends **LCU API** via local HTTPS using:
- Application port
- Authentication token

These values are extracted directly from the `LeagueClientUx.exe` process command line.
